🔍 Performance Comparison: Naive-Bayes vs. Neural Networks on Hypothyroid Dataset 🤖

I'm excited to share some insights from my recent work comparing the performance metrics of two machine learning algorithms: "Gaussian Naive-Bayes" and "MLPClassifier" (a type of neural network).

Here's a quick summary of my findings:

📊 Performance Metrics Evaluated:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

Algorithms Used:
- Gaussian Naive-Bayes
- MLPClassifier

Key Observations:
- The Gaussian Naive-Bayes algorithm trained the dataset in less time compared to the MLP classifier.
- However, the MLP classifier outperformed Gaussian Naive-Bayes in prediction accuracy.

Results:
- Overall performance metric for Gaussian Naive-Bayes: **0.7 (70%)**
- Overall performance metric for MLPClassifier: **0.99 (99%)**

The neural network's ability to predict the data was significantly better, achieving near-perfect predictions.

🔬 These results highlight the trade-off between training time and prediction accuracy, demonstrating the superior predictive power of neural networks on this dataset.
